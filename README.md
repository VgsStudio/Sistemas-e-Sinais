# Why this repository?
This repository is a collection of my notes and exercises from the [Python Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yBPEPhq54M&t=193s) by [MrPSolver](https://www.youtube.com/@MrPSolver).
I'm using this repository to learn SymPy and to practice my Markdown and Latex skills.

# What is SymPy?
SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.
